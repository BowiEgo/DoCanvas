// LayoutObject is the base class for all layout tree objects.
//
// LayoutObjects form a tree structure that is a close mapping of the DOM tree.
// The root of the LayoutObject tree is the LayoutView, which is the
// LayoutObject associated with the Document.
//
// Some LayoutObjects don't have an associated Node and are called "anonymous"
// (see the constructor below). Anonymous LayoutObjects exist for several
// purposes but are usually required by CSS. A good example is anonymous table
// parts (see LayoutNGTable for the expected structure). Anonymous LayoutObjects
// are generated when a new child is added to the tree in addChild(). See the
// function for some important information on this.
//
// Also some Node don't have an associated LayoutObjects e.g. if display: none
// or display: contents is set. For more detail, see LayoutObject::createObject
// that creates the right LayoutObject based on the style.
//
// Because the SVG and CSS classes both inherit from this object, functions can
// belong to either realm and sometimes to both.
//
// The purpose of the layout tree is to do layout (aka reflow) and store its
// results for painting and hit-testing. Layout is the process of sizing and
// positioning Nodes on the page. In Blink, layouts always start from a relayout
// boundary (see ObjectIsRelayoutBoundary in layout_object.cc). As such, we
// need to mark the ancestors all the way to the enclosing relayout boundary in
// order to do a correct layout.
//
// Due to the high cost of layout, a lot of effort is done to avoid doing full
// layouts of nodes. This is why there are several types of layout available to
// bypass the complex operations. See the comments on the layout booleans in
// LayoutObjectBitfields below about the different layouts.
//
// To save memory, especially for the common child class LayoutText,
// LayoutObject doesn't provide storage for children. Descendant classes that do
// allow children have to have a LayoutObjectChildList member that stores the
// actual children and override virtualChildren().
//
// LayoutObject is an ImageResourceObserver, which means that it gets notified
// when associated images are changed. This is used for 2 main use cases:
// - reply to 'background-image' as we need to invalidate the background in this
//   case.
//   (See https://drafts.csswg.org/css-backgrounds-3/#the-background-image)
// - image (LayoutImage, LayoutSVGImage) or video (LayoutVideo) objects that are
//   placeholders for displaying them.
//
//
// ***** LIFETIME *****
//
// LayoutObjects are fully owned by their associated DOM node. In other words,
// it's the DOM node's responsibility to free its LayoutObject, this is why
// LayoutObjects are not and SHOULD NOT be RefCounted.
//
// LayoutObjects are created during the DOM attachment. This phase computes
// the style and create the LayoutObject associated with the Node (see
// Node::attachLayoutTree). LayoutObjects are destructed during detachment (see
// Node::detachLayoutTree), which can happen when the DOM node is removed from
// the
// DOM tree, during page tear down or when the style is changed to contain
// 'display: none'.
//
// Anonymous LayoutObjects are owned by their enclosing DOM node. This means
// that if the DOM node is detached, it has to destroy any anonymous
// descendants. This is done in LayoutObject::destroy().
//
// Note that for correctness, destroy() is expected to clean any anonymous
// wrappers as sequences of insertion / removal could make them visible to
// the page. This is done by LayoutObject::destroyAndCleanupAnonymousWrappers()
// which is the preferred way to destroy an object.
//
//
// ***** INTRINSIC SIZES / PREFERRED LOGICAL WIDTHS *****
// The preferred logical widths are the intrinsic sizes of this element
// (https://drafts.csswg.org/css-sizing-3/#intrinsic). Intrinsic sizes depend
// mostly on the content and a limited set of style properties (e.g. any
// font-related property for text, 'min-width'/'max-width',
// 'min-height'/'max-height').
//
// Those widths are used to determine the final layout logical width, which
// depends on the layout algorithm used and the available logical width.
//
// LayoutObject only has a getter for the widths (PreferredLogicalWidths).
// However the storage for them is in LayoutBox (see
// min_preferred_logical_width_ and max_preferred_logical_width_). This is
// because only boxes implementing the full box model have a need for them.
// Because LayoutBlockFlow's intrinsic widths rely on the underlying text
// content, LayoutBlockFlow may call LayoutText::ComputePreferredLogicalWidths.
//
// The 2 widths are computed lazily during layout when the getters are called.
// The computation is done by calling ComputePreferredLogicalWidths() behind the
// scene. The boolean used to control the lazy recomputation is
// IntrinsicLogicalWidthsDirty.
//
// See the individual getters below for more details about what each width is.
